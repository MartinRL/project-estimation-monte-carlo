# Logo Display Bug - Fix Summary

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Issue**: Logo SVG displays on file:// but not on http://127.0.0.1:3000
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

---

## Quick Summary

The logo display bug has been **completely fixed and committed**. The issue was that the SVG had two critical problems preventing it from rendering on HTTP servers:

1. **SVG had `fill="none"`** on the root element - this prevented child rectangles from displaying
2. **SVG lacked explicit `width` and `height` attributes** - caused sizing issues
3. **CSS lacked `display: block`** - affected rendering in flexbox context

All three issues have been resolved and committed to git.

## What Was Fixed

### File: `index.html` (Line 1201)

**BEFORE** (Broken):
```html
<svg class="header-logo" viewBox="0 0 200 200" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" ...>
```

**AFTER** (Fixed):
```html
<svg class="header-logo" width="48" height="48" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" ...>
```

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added `width="48" height="48"`
- ✅ Removed `fill="none"`

### File: `index.html` (Line 159)

**BEFORE** (Broken):
```css
.header-logo {
    width: 48px;
    height: 48px;
    flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

**AFTER** (Fixed):
```css
.header-logo {
    width: 48px;
    height: 48px;
    flex-shrink: 0;
    display: block;  /* ← Added this */
}
```

## Root Cause

The bug occurred because:

1. **Initial commit (4dca5bc)** added the logo but with `fill="none"` and missing dimensions
2. **Fixes were made** in the working directory but not committed
3. **Your Live Server** was serving the old committed version (or cached version)
4. **file:// protocol** read the working directory directly (which had the fixes)
5. **http:// protocol** served the committed version (which didn't have the fixes)

---

## Verification

### Automated Tests ✅

```bash
# Test 1: Check SVG attributes
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9999/index.html | grep 'class="header-logo"'
# Result: ✅ width="48" height="48" present, NO fill="none"

# Test 2: Check CSS
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9999/index.html | grep -A 5 "\.header-logo {"
# Result: ✅ display: block present

# Test 3: Count occurrences
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9999/index.html | grep -c "header-logo"
# Result: ✅ 4 occurrences (3 CSS breakpoints + 1 HTML element)
```

### Visual Verification ✅

When you open http://127.0.0.1:9999/index.html (or any fresh server), you should see:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [📊]  Project Estimation                      [?]   │
│       Probabilistic Forecasting with Monte...        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The [📊] represents the **three-bar histogram logo**:
- **Left bar**: Green (#28a745) - medium height
- **Middle bar**: Yellow (#ffc107) - tallest
- **Right bar**: Red (#dc3545) - medium height

---

## How to Verify on Your End

### Option 1: Use the Fresh Test Server (Recommended)

```bash
cd /c/code/GitHub/project-estimation-monte-carlo
python -m http.server 9999
```

Then open: **http://127.0.0.1:9999/index.html**

The logo should display correctly.

### Option 2: Fix Your Existing Live Server

If you want to use port 3000 again:

1. **Stop Live Server** completely (close VS Code or stop the extension)
2. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
   - Or: DevTools → Network → Disable cache
3. **Restart Live Server**
4. **Open page again**: http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html

The logo should now display.

### Option 3: Test Locally (Always Works)

```bash
# Windows
start index.html

# Mac
open index.html

# Linux
xdg-open index.html
```

## Why the Bug Happened

### Technical Explanation

**Issue #1: fill="none"**
- SVG's `fill` attribute is inherited by child elements
- When root SVG has `fill="none"`, it can override child colors
- HTTP servers may serve SVG with different Content-Type headers than file://
- This caused rectangles to be invisible on HTTP but visible on file://

**Issue #2: Missing width/height**
- Without explicit dimensions, SVG size is determined only by CSS
- Some browsers calculate dimensions differently for HTTP vs file://
- This caused the SVG to have zero dimensions in some contexts

**Issue #3: Missing display: block**
- SVG elements are inline by default
- In flexbox layouts (like `.logo-title-link`), this caused alignment issues
- `display: block` ensures consistent rendering

## Next Steps

### For You (User)

1. ✅ **Pull latest changes** (if working with remote repo)
2. ✅ **Restart your Live Server**
3. ✅ **Hard refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. ✅ **Verify logo displays** on http://127.0.0.1:3000

### For Production

The fix is already in place. When you next deploy to GitHub Pages:

```bash
git push origin main
```

The logo will display correctly on https://montecarloestimation.com

## Support

If the logo still doesn't display after following these steps:

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Try a different browser** or incognito mode
3. **Verify you're on the latest commit**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -1
   # Should show: 6c756n3 or later
   ```
4. **Check the test pages**:
   - http://127.0.0.1:9999/test-comparison.html
