## 🎯 Next Steps (Requires Manual Action)

### Step 1: Enable HTTPS on GitHub Pages - COMPLETE

**Status**: DNS propagated and HTTPS enabled

DNS verified pointing to GitHub Pages IPs (185.199.x.x).

---

### Step 2: Create Google Analytics 4 Property - COMPLETE

**Status**: GA4 tracking active

Property created and tracking code deployed to production.

---

### Step 3: Apply for Google AdSense

**Prerequisites**:
- [x] Site is live at custom domain
- [x] HTTPS enabled
- [x] Privacy Policy published
- [x] Quality content on site
- [x] GA4 tracking active

**Where**: https://www.google.com/adsense

**Steps**:
- [x] 1. Sign in with Google account

- [x] 3. Website URL: `https://montecarloestimation.com`
- [x] 4. Copy the AdSense verification code
- [x] 5. Paste it in `index.html` `<head>` section (below GA4 code)
- [ ] 6. Submit for review

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for approval

**While waiting**:
- Monitor GA4 to see traffic patterns
- Check DebugView to verify events are firing correctly
- Review AdSense policies: https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182

### Step 4: Implement AdSense Ads (After Approval) - COMPLETE

**Status**: Auto Ads configured

**Implementation**:

## 📊 Monitoring After Launch

### Google Analytics 4 Dashboard

**Key Reports**:
1. **Engagement** → Events
   - Check `generate_forecast` count (most important!)
   - Monitor `view_help` (indicates confusion or interest)
   - Track `add_risk` (advanced users)

2. **Acquisition** → Traffic acquisition
   - Where users are coming from
   - Which sources lead to forecast generation

3. **Real-time** → Overview
   - See live users
   - Verify events are firing

**Target Metrics** (first month):
- Forecast Completion Rate: >50%
- Avg Session Duration: >2 min
- Bounce Rate: <60%

### Google AdSense Dashboard

**After ads go live, monitor**:
1. **Performance** → Reports
   - CTR by ad unit (target: 2-3%)
   - RPM (revenue per 1000 impressions)
   - Revenue by device

2. **Optimization** → Experiments
   - Test different ad sizes
   - Try Auto Ads (optional)

**Revenue Expectations**:
- Month 1-3: $70-150/month (conservative)
- After ProductHunt launch: $1,500-3,000/month (optimistic)
