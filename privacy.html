However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

By using our Service, you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States and other countries.</p>

        <h2>11. Do Not Track Signals</h2>

        <p>Some web browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. We do not currently respond to Do Not Track signals. However, you can opt out of Google Analytics and personalized advertising as described in Section 3.</p>
