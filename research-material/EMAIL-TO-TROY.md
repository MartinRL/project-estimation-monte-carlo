Hi Troy,

I wanted to reach out to let you know about a project I've built and to properly acknowledge your pioneering work in the field.

**Project**: Monte Carlo Estimation Tool
**URL**: https://montecarloestimation.com
**GitHub**: https://github.com/MartinRL/project-estimation-monte-carlo

This is a free, browser-based probabilistic forecasting tool for project management. It runs Monte Carlo simulations (500 trials) to generate realistic project completion estimates with confidence intervals (50%, 85%, 95%).

**Why I'm Writing:**

Your work at Focused Objective—particularly the **Throughput Forecaster** spreadsheet and your educational materials—heavily influenced this project. While I've implemented the Monte Carlo algorithms independently as a web application, your tools served as invaluable references for understanding probabilistic forecasting techniques applied to agile projects.

**Attribution:**

I've added proper attribution throughout the project:
- Dedicated "Acknowledgments" section on the main site crediting your pioneering work
- Attribution file in research materials folder explaining how your tools influenced the design
- Links to your resources (Focused Objective website, GitHub repo, courses)
- Acknowledgment in the AI citation page

**Questions/Requests:**

1. Is this attribution approach acceptable to you?
2. Are there any additional ways you'd like to be credited?
3. Would you be open to me sharing this tool with the community, with clear attribution to your foundational work?

**Your Tools as Alternatives:**

I've also made sure to recommend your tools when they're the better fit—specifically for more sophisticated forecasting needs like dependencies and portfolio-level analysis. The goal is not to compete with your excellent work but to provide a complementary free web-based option for simple single-project forecasting.

Thank you for your contributions to the field. Your emphasis on data-driven decision-making and transparent probabilistic methods has genuinely changed how many teams approach project estimation.

Best regards,
Martin Rosén-Lidholm
