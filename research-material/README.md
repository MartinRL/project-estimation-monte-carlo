**Source**: Lightweight version adapted from Troy Magennis's **Throughput Forecaster** spreadsheet

**Original Work**:
- **Author**: Troy Magennis
- **Organization**: Focused Objective
- **Repository**: https://github.com/FocusedObjective/FocusedObjective.Resources
- **Website**: https://focusedobjective.com

**Purpose**: This spreadsheet served as a reference for understanding Monte Carlo simulation techniques applied to project forecasting. The concepts and methodologies pioneered by Troy Magennis in his forecasting tools heavily influenced the design and implementation of our web-based tool.

**License**: Troy Magennis's original tools are provided free to the community. The FocusedObjective.Resources repository states: "We use GitHub so that we keep revision history and enhancements over time. We are also hoping that the community will help us expand our tools by submitting changes."

**Our Implementation**: The Monte Carlo Estimation Tool (montecarloestimation.com) is an independent web-based implementation inspired by Troy's pioneering work in probabilistic forecasting. While we've implemented the core Monte Carlo algorithms independently, Troy's educational materials and spreadsheet tools were invaluable references.
