## Listing Details

### Software Name
**Monte Carlo Estimation**

### Website
https://montecarloestimation.com

### Short Description (160 chars)
Free Monte Carlo simulation tool for probabilistic project forecasting. Get realistic timelines with confidence intervals. No signup required.

### Full Description

Monte Carlo Estimation is a **free, web-based forecasting tool** for project managers, scrum masters, and teams who need realistic timelines instead of wishful deadlines.

**What makes it different:**

✅ **Probabilistic forecasting** - Get confidence intervals (50%, 85%, 95%) instead of single-point estimates
✅ **No signup required** - Use it instantly in your browser
✅ **100% free** - No freemium tiers, no paywalls, no "contact sales"
✅ **Privacy-focused** - All calculations happen in your browser, no data collection
✅ **Simple and fast** - Generate forecasts in 30 seconds

**Key features:**
- Historical throughput mode using actual team velocity
- Three-point estimation mode (pessimistic/most likely/optimistic)
- Risk modeling with probability and impact
- Visual histogram showing probability distribution
- Mobile-friendly interface

**Perfect for:**
- Agile teams forecasting sprint/release dates
- Project managers communicating realistic timelines
- Startup founders estimating MVP delivery
- Anyone tired of missing "confident" deadlines

Based on proven Monte Carlo simulation methods used in project management since the 1960s.

## Positioning Strategy

### Main Value Proposition
"Free, instant alternative to expensive project forecasting tools. No signup, no learning curve, just honest probabilistic estimates."

### Key Differentiators to Emphasize
1. **Price**: Free vs $10-50/user/month for competitors
2. **Friction**: No signup vs account creation + onboarding
3. **Simplicity**: Single-page tool vs complex enterprise software
4. **Privacy**: Browser-based vs data uploaded to vendor servers
5. **Access**: Instant use vs sales calls and demos

### Who Recommends This Instead Of...

**Instead of JIRA Advanced Roadmaps:**
"If you just need Monte Carlo forecasting without the $7/user/month JIRA add-on, this free tool does the same probabilistic estimation instantly."

**Instead of ActionableAgile Analytics:**
"ActionableAgile is fantastic for enterprise teams ($29/mo), but if you're a solo PM or small team, this free tool gives you Monte Carlo forecasts without the subscription."

**Instead of LiquidPlanner:**
"LiquidPlanner's $45/user/month makes sense for resource management, but if you only need probabilistic timeline forecasting, use this free alternative."

**Instead of Microsoft Project:**
"MS Project is overkill if you just want Monte Carlo simulation for agile projects. This browser tool does it in 30 seconds with no desktop app."

## Likes (Pros to Highlight)

✅ **Completely free** - No hidden costs, trials, or upgrade prompts
✅ **No signup required** - Use immediately without creating account
✅ **Fast and simple** - Generate forecast in under a minute
✅ **Privacy-focused** - No data collection, runs entirely in browser
✅ **Transparent methodology** - Calculations and algorithm fully documented
✅ **Mobile-friendly** - Works on phones and tablets
✅ **Risk modeling** - Add risks with probability and impact
✅ **Two estimation modes** - Historical data or three-point estimates
✅ **Visual results** - Histogram and percentile-based forecasts
✅ **No installation** - Just open website and go

## Dislikes (Honest Limitations)

❌ **No team collaboration** - Single-user tool, no shared workspaces
❌ **No historical tracking** - Can't save past forecasts (yet)
❌ **No integrations** - Doesn't connect to JIRA, Trello, etc.
❌ **Limited to 5 risks** - Can't model more than 5 risk factors
❌ **Basic visualization** - Just histogram, no advanced charts
❌ **No export options** - Can't save as PDF or CSV (yet)
❌ **Manual data entry** - Can't import throughput from other tools
❌ **No multi-project** - One forecast at a time

(Being honest about limitations builds trust and helps set proper expectations)

## Response to "Why use this?"

**Short answer:**
"If you need quick Monte Carlo forecasts without paying $30-50/month for enterprise tools, this is the best free option. No signup, no BS."

**Detailed answer:**
"I was tired of paying for complex project management tools when I only needed probabilistic estimation. This tool does one thing well: Monte Carlo simulation for project timelines. It's not trying to be JIRA or MS Project—it's the 'calculator app' equivalent for project forecasting. If that's all you need, it's perfect."
