## Product Description

### Short Description (500 chars)
Monte Carlo Estimation is a free web-based tool for probabilistic project forecasting. Instead of single-point estimates that are often wrong, get realistic timelines with confidence intervals (50%, 85%, 95% likelihood). Uses Monte Carlo simulation with your team's historical throughput or three-point estimates. Add risk modeling, visualize probability distributions, and communicate realistic expectations to stakeholders. No signup, no data collection, runs instantly in your browser.

### Full Description (2000 chars)

**The Problem:**
Traditional project estimation gives you one deadline: "We'll be done by March 15th." But projects are unpredictable‚Äîteam velocity varies, requirements change, and risks materialize. Single-point estimates are almost always wrong, leading to missed deadlines and broken stakeholder trust.

**The Solution:**
Monte Carlo Estimation uses statistical simulation to provide **realistic forecasts with confidence intervals**. Instead of one date, you get:
- 50% confidence: "We're 50% likely to finish by this date"
- 85% confidence: "We're 85% likely to finish by this date"
- 95% confidence: "We're 95% likely to finish by this date"

This helps project managers communicate uncertainty honestly and set realistic stakeholder expectations.

**Key Features:**

**Two Estimation Modes:**
1. Historical Throughput: Use your team's actual weekly velocity data
2. Three-Point Estimates: Use pessimistic/most likely/optimistic ranges

**Risk Modeling:**
- Add up to 5 risks with custom probability and impact ranges
- See how risks affect your timeline forecast
- Model scope creep, technical unknowns, and dependency delays

**Visual Analytics:**
- Probability distribution histogram
- Percentile-based forecast dates (50%, 85%, 95%)
- Clear visualization of uncertainty

**Privacy & Speed:**
- No account creation or signup required
- All calculations run in your browser‚Äîno data sent to servers
- Generate forecasts in 30 seconds
- Works on desktop and mobile

**100% Free:**
- No freemium tiers or paywalls
- No "contact sales" for features
- No user limits or usage caps
- Transparent methodology fully documented

**Ideal For:**
- Agile teams forecasting sprint/release dates
- Project managers communicating realistic timelines
- Scrum masters planning capacity
- Engineering managers estimating delivery
- Startup founders projecting MVP completion

Based on proven Monte Carlo simulation methods used in project management since the 1960s. Grounded in sound statistical theory (Central Limit Theorem).

## Customer Reviews (To Request)

### Ideal Review Quote 1 (From a PM)
"Finally, a free tool that does Monte Carlo simulation without the $50/month subscription. I use it every sprint for release forecasting. Takes 30 seconds to get realistic timelines."
‚Äî *[PM Name]*, Project Manager at *[Company]*

### Ideal Review Quote 2 (From a Scrum Master)
"Our stakeholders love the confidence interval approach. Instead of promising one date, I show them '70% likely by May 1st, 90% likely by May 15th.' Sets realistic expectations."
‚Äî *[Name]*, Scrum Master at *[Company]*

### Ideal Review Quote 3 (From a Startup Founder)
"We're a bootstrapped startup‚Äîcan't afford LiquidPlanner or MS Project. This free tool gives us the same probabilistic forecasting. It's our secret weapon for investor updates."
‚Äî *[Name]*, Founder at *[Startup]*
