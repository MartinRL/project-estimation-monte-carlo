### One-Liner (Short Description)
Free probabilistic project forecasting using Monte Carlo simulation—get realistic timelines with confidence intervals.

### Description (Full)

**Stop Missing Deadlines with Probabilistic Forecasting**

Monte Carlo Estimation is a **free web-based tool** that helps project managers, scrum masters, and agile teams create realistic project forecasts using statistical simulation.

**The Traditional Estimation Problem:**

Most teams estimate projects with a single deadline: "We'll be done March 15th." But this ignores the inherent uncertainty in project work. Teams work at different speeds, requirements evolve, and risks materialize. That single-point estimate is almost always wrong.

**The Monte Carlo Solution:**

Instead of one date, Monte Carlo Estimation runs **500+ statistical simulations** using your team's actual throughput data. You get realistic forecasts with confidence intervals:

- **50th percentile**: 50% chance of finishing by this date
- **85th percentile**: 85% confidence of completion
- **95th percentile**: 95% confidence of completion

This approach is grounded in proven statistical methods (Monte Carlo simulation + Central Limit Theorem) used in project management since the 1960s.

**Key Capabilities:**

**Dual Estimation Modes:**
1. **Historical Data Mode**: Input your team's actual weekly throughput samples (velocity)
2. **Three-Point Estimate Mode**: Use pessimistic/most likely/optimistic ranges

**Risk Modeling:**
- Model up to 5 project risks
- Define probability of occurrence (0-100%)
- Set impact range (story point increase)
- See how risks affect your timeline

**Visual Analytics:**
- Histogram showing probability distribution across 500 trials
- Percentile-based forecast dates (50%, 85%, 95%)
- Clear visualization of uncertainty

**Privacy & Performance:**
- No account creation required—use instantly
- All calculations in-browser—no data uploaded
- Generate forecasts in under 30 seconds
- Mobile-responsive interface

**100% Free:**
- No freemium model or paywalls
- No "enterprise" features locked behind pricing
- No user limits or usage caps
- Open methodology documentation

**Best For:**

- **Agile Teams**: Forecasting sprint completions and release dates
- **Project Managers**: Communicating realistic timelines to stakeholders
- **Scrum Masters**: Planning capacity and setting expectations
- **Engineering Managers**: Estimating feature delivery
- **Startup Founders**: Projecting MVP or product launch dates
- **Consultants**: Quick client forecasts without expensive tools

**Why Users Choose Monte Carlo Estimation:**

✅ Only free Monte Carlo tool with zero friction
✅ No learning curve—intuitive interface
✅ Transparent methodology (fully documented)
✅ Privacy-focused (no data collection)
✅ Fast (30-second forecasts)
✅ No installation or signup barriers

**Differentiators vs. Paid Alternatives:**

Unlike enterprise tools like LiquidPlanner ($45/user/mo), ActionableAgile Analytics ($29/mo), or JIRA Advanced Roadmaps ($7/user/mo), Monte Carlo Estimation strips away complexity and gives you just what you need: honest, probabilistic forecasts.

No resource allocation. No time tracking. No Gantt charts. Just fast, accurate forecasting based on sound statistics.
