## Phase 1: Research & Discovery (🤖 Robot) ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-30)

### 🤖 Search Results Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Slant has **ZERO coverage** of estimation methodologies! It's full of PM tools (JIRA, Trello) but has NO questions about HOW to estimate projects.

**FOUND - 1 Existing Question (EMPTY!):**
1. ✅ "What are the best scrum poker services online?" - **0 RECOMMENDATIONS** 🎯
   - URL: https://www.slant.co/improve/topics/22981/~scrum-poker-services-online
   - Competitors: NONE (we'll be FIRST!)
   - Perfect fit: Monte Carlo is an alternative to planning poker
   - **Positioning**: Modern statistical alternative to scrum poker estimation

**NOT FOUND - Create These Questions:**
2. ❌ "What are the best project estimation techniques for agile teams?" - **CREATE THIS**
3. ❌ "What are the best Monte Carlo simulation tools for project forecasting?" - **CREATE THIS**
4. ❌ "What are the best alternatives to Planning Poker?" - **CREATE THIS**

**Wrong Questions (Ignore These - They're PM Tools, Not Estimation):**
- ❌ "What are the best agile project management tools?" (39 recs - Trello, JIRA, Asana)
- ❌ "What are the best PM tools for freelancers?" (80 recs - wrong category)
- ❌ "What are the best JIRA alternatives?" (wrong category)

**Key Insight**: Slant is **heavily PM-tool focused** but has **zero estimation methodology coverage**. This is a golden opportunity to CREATE and OWN the entire "project estimation" category!

## Quick Copy-Paste Reference

### Product Name
```
Monte Carlo Estimation
```

### Website
```
https://montecarloestimation.com
```

### One-Line Description
```
Free probabilistic project forecasting with Monte Carlo simulation—get realistic timelines with confidence intervals.
```

### Full Description (Standard)
```
Monte Carlo Estimation is a **free, web-based forecasting tool** that uses statistical simulation to help teams create realistic project timelines.

**How it works:**
Instead of guessing a single deadline ("We'll be done March 15th"), you input your team's throughput data and story count. The tool runs 500+ Monte Carlo simulations and gives you realistic forecasts with confidence intervals:

- 50% confidence: "You're 50% likely to finish by this date"
- 85% confidence: "You're 85% likely to finish by this date"
- 95% confidence: "You're 95% likely to finish by this date"

**Key features:**
- Two modes: Historical throughput OR three-point estimates
- Risk modeling with probability and impact
- Visual histogram showing probability distribution
- 100% free, no signup, runs in browser
- Privacy-focused (no data collection)

**Best for:**
Agile teams, scrum masters, project managers, and startup founders who need quick, honest forecasts without enterprise tool complexity or cost.

Based on proven Monte Carlo methods used in project management since the 1960s.
```

### Full Description (For Scrum Poker Question)
```
Monte Carlo Estimation is a **statistical alternative to scrum poker** that uses Monte Carlo simulation instead of consensus-based card voting.

**How it's different from planning poker:**
- No need for group meetings or card voting
- Uses math (Monte Carlo simulation) instead of gut feel
- Gives you probability ranges, not single-point estimates
- Forecasts actual completion dates, not just relative story points

**How it works:**
Input your team's throughput data and story count. The tool runs 500+ simulations and gives you realistic forecasts with confidence intervals:

- 50% confidence: "You're 50% likely to finish by this date"
- 85% confidence: "You're 85% likely to finish by this date"
- 95% confidence: "You're 95% likely to finish by this date"

**Key features:**
- Two modes: Historical throughput OR three-point estimates
- Risk modeling with probability and impact
- Visual histogram showing probability distribution
- 100% free, no signup, runs in browser
- Privacy-focused (no data collection)

**Best for:**
Teams that want data-driven forecasts instead of consensus-based estimation games.

Based on proven Monte Carlo methods used in project management since the 1960s.
