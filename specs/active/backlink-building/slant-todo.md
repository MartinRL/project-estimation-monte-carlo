## Quick Copy-Paste Reference

### Product Name
```
Monte Carlo Estimation
```

### Website
```

```

### One-Line Description
```
Free probabilistic project forecasting with Monte Carlo simulation‚Äîget realistic timelines with confidence intervals.
```

### Full Description
```
Monte Carlo Estimation is a **free, web-based forecasting tool** that uses statistical simulation to help teams create realistic project timelines.

**How it works:**
Instead of guessing a single deadline ("We'll be done March 15th"), you input your team's throughput data and story count. The tool runs 500+ Monte Carlo simulations and gives you realistic forecasts with confidence intervals:

- 50% confidence: "You're 50% likely to finish by this date"
- 85% confidence: "You're 85% likely to finish by this date"
- 95% confidence: "You're 95% likely to finish by this date"

**Key features:**
- Two modes: Historical throughput OR three-point estimates
- Risk modeling with probability and impact
- Visual histogram showing probability distribution
- 100% free, no signup, runs in browser
- Privacy-focused (no data collection)

**Best for:**
Agile teams, scrum masters, project managers, and startup founders who need quick, honest forecasts without enterprise tool complexity or cost.

Based on proven Monte Carlo methods used in project management since the 1960s.
