# Capterra Listing - NOT SUITABLE FOR THIS PROJECT

## 🚫 REALITY CHECK (Oct 31, 2024) - DO NOT SUBMIT

**This tool is NOT appropriate for Gartner/Capterra submission.**

### Why This Won't Work

**Gartner Digital Markets (Capterra/GetApp/Software Advice) is designed for:**
- Enterprise B2B software with pricing tiers ($$$)
- Products with user accounts, dashboards, and APIs
- Companies with support teams and SLAs
- Software that requires demos and sales calls
- Tools competing with Jira ($35k/year), Monday.com ($30/user/month), MS Project

**Monte Carlo Estimation is:**
- A single HTML file (literally one file)
- A simple calculator (like a mortgage calculator)
- No backend, no accounts, no database
- No pricing model (nothing to upsell)
- No "vendor" organization behind it
- More of a **useful formula** than "enterprise software"

### The Mismatch

Submitting this to Capterra would be like:
- Listing a paper airplane next to Boeing 747s
- Putting a lemonade stand in the Fortune 500
- Submitting a calculator app to compete with SAP

**It would either:**
- ❌ Get rejected as "not substantial enough"
- 😬 Look ridiculous next to $50k/year enterprise tools
- 🦗 Get zero traffic (Capterra users want "real" software with support)

### Better Alternatives

This tool belongs on:
1. **ProductHunt** - Loves simple, useful indie tools
2. **Hacker News** - "Show HN: Monte Carlo estimation in one HTML file"
3. **Reddit** - r/agile, r/projectmanagement would appreciate it
4. **Medium/Dev.to** - Write about WHY you built it
5. **GitHub** - You're already there, just need promotion
6. **Twitter/LinkedIn** - PM influencers share free tools

The tool is GREAT because it's simple. Don't pretend it's enterprise software.

## Product Description

### Short Description (500 chars)
Monte Carlo Estimation is a free web-based tool for probabilistic project forecasting. Instead of single-point estimates that are often wrong, get realistic timelines with confidence intervals (50%, 85%, 95% likelihood). Uses Monte Carlo simulation with your team's historical throughput or three-point estimates. Add risk modeling, visualize probability distributions, and communicate realistic expectations to stakeholders. No signup, no data collection, runs instantly in your browser.

### Full Description (2000 chars)

**The Problem:**
Traditional project estimation gives you one deadline: "We'll be done by March 15th." But projects are unpredictable—team velocity varies, requirements change, and risks materialize. Single-point estimates are almost always wrong, leading to missed deadlines and broken stakeholder trust.

**The Solution:**
Monte Carlo Estimation uses statistical simulation to provide **realistic forecasts with confidence intervals**. Instead of one date, you get:
- 50% confidence: "We're 50% likely to finish by this date"
- 85% confidence: "We're 85% likely to finish by this date"
- 95% confidence: "We're 95% likely to finish by this date"

This helps project managers communicate uncertainty honestly and set realistic stakeholder expectations.

**Key Features:**

**Two Estimation Modes:**
1. Historical Throughput: Use your team's actual weekly velocity data
2. Three-Point Estimates: Use pessimistic/most likely/optimistic ranges

**Risk Modeling:**
- Add up to 5 risks with custom probability and impact ranges
- See how risks affect your timeline forecast
- Model scope creep, technical unknowns, and dependency delays

**Visual Analytics:**
- Probability distribution histogram
- Percentile-based forecast dates (50%, 85%, 95%)
- Clear visualization of uncertainty

**Privacy & Speed:**
- No account creation or signup required
- All calculations run in your browser—no data sent to servers
- Generate forecasts in 30 seconds
- Works on desktop and mobile

**100% Free:**
- No freemium tiers or paywalls
- No "contact sales" for features
- No user limits or usage caps
- Transparent methodology fully documented

**Ideal For:**
- Agile teams forecasting sprint/release dates
- Project managers communicating realistic timelines
- Scrum masters planning capacity
- Engineering managers estimating delivery
- Startup founders projecting MVP completion

Based on proven Monte Carlo simulation methods used in project management since the 1960s. Grounded in sound statistical theory (Central Limit Theorem).

— *[PM Name]*, Project Manager at *[Company]*

### Ideal Review Quote 2 (From a Scrum Master)
"Our stakeholders love the confidence interval approach. Instead of promising one date, I show them '70% likely by May 1st, 90% likely by May 15th.' Sets realistic expectations."
— *[Name]*, Scrum Master at *[Company]*
