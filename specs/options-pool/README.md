# Options Pool

## What is This?

The options pool is a **lean approach to managing feature ideas** - a lightweight holding area for unstructured, non-prioritized concepts that might become features someday.

## Concept

Inspired by lean team workflows, the options pool follows a **just-in-time (JIT) pull model**:

- **Capture ideas quickly** - No formal structure, prioritization, or detailed planning required
- **Pull when ready** - When you want to work on something, pull an option from the pool
- **Refine just-in-time** - Move to `specs/active/`, create proper spec, plan, implement

## How It Works

1. **Add new ideas here** as individual markdown files using the template
2. **No prioritization needed** - This is not a ranked backlog
3. **When ready to work** on an idea:
   - Move the file from `options-pool/` to `specs/active/`
   - Expand it into a full spec (use appropriate template from `specs/`)
   - Plan and implement following the 3-phase workflow

## Why This Approach?

**Avoids:**
- Analysis paralysis - don't need full specs for every idea
- Stale backlogs - no forced prioritization that becomes outdated
- Lost ideas - quick capture without overhead

**Enables:**
- Fast idea capture
- Flexibility - decide what's important when you're ready to work
- Low friction - minimal process overhead

## Template

Use `TEMPLATE-option.md` for new options. Keep it lightweight - just enough to remember what the idea was.
