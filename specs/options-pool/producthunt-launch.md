## Full Description

### What is Monte Carlo Estimation?

Monte Carlo Estimation is a **free, no-signup project forecasting tool** that uses statistical simulations to give you realistic timelines with confidence intervals—not just a single (often wrong) deadline.

### The Problem

Traditional project estimation gives you **one date**: "We'll be done by March 15th." But projects are unpredictable. Teams work at different speeds, requirements change, and risks materialize. That single-point estimate is almost always wrong.

### The Solution

Instead of one date, Monte Carlo Estimation runs **500+ simulations** using your team's actual throughput data (or three-point estimates). It shows you:

- **50th percentile**: "We have a 50% chance of finishing by this date"
- **85th percentile**: "We're 85% confident we'll finish by this date"
- **95th percentile**: "We're 95% confident we'll finish by this date"

This gives stakeholders **realistic expectations** and helps you communicate uncertainty honestly.

### Key Features

✅ **Two estimation modes**
- Historical throughput: Use your team's actual weekly velocity
- Three-point estimates: Use pessimistic/most likely/optimistic ranges

✅ **Risk modeling**
- Add up to 5 risks with probability and impact
- See how they affect your forecast

✅ **Visual results**
- Histogram showing probability distribution
- Percentile-based forecasts (50%, 85%, 95%)

✅ **100% free and private**
- No signup required
- No data collection
- Runs entirely in your browser
- Open calculation methodology

✅ **Fast and simple**
- Single-page app
- Generate forecast in 30 seconds
- Works on mobile

### Who It's For

- **Project managers** who need to communicate realistic timelines
- **Scrum masters** forecasting sprint/release dates
- **Engineering managers** planning capacity
- **Product owners** setting stakeholder expectations
- **Startup founders** estimating MVP delivery

### Why We Built This

Every PM has been burned by overpromising a deadline. We wanted a **simple, transparent, free tool** based on proven statistical methods (Monte Carlo simulations have been used in project management since the 1960s).

No paywalls. No "contact sales." No locked features. Just honest forecasting.

### Differentiators

- **Only free Monte Carlo tool** with no signup wall
- **Fully transparent methodology** (documented on site)
- **Privacy-focused** (no data leaves your browser)
- **No dependencies** (pure HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Mobile-friendly**

### What's Next

We're actively improving based on user feedback:
- Export to PDF
- Save/share forecast configurations via URL
- Progressive Web App for offline use
- Higher simulation counts for more precision

### Try It Now

👉 https://montecarloestimation.com

No account needed. Just enter your data and get your forecast in 30 seconds.

## Maker Comment (Post as first comment after launch)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to share **Monte Carlo Estimation** - a free tool that's helped me (and hopefully you) stop making overly optimistic project promises.

### The backstory

After years of seeing projects miss "confident" deadlines, I got tired of the traditional "best guess" estimation. The problem isn't that teams are lazy—it's that **single-point estimates ignore uncertainty**.

Monte Carlo simulation solves this by running hundreds of scenarios using your team's actual throughput. Instead of "We'll be done March 15th" (narrator: they weren't), you get "50% chance by March 15th, 85% chance by April 2nd."

### Why it's free

Estimation tools shouldn't be gated behind $50/month subscriptions. This is pure HTML/JavaScript—no backend, no data collection, no signup friction.

### I'd love your feedback on:

1. **Is the UX clear?** Too much jargon? Confusing inputs?
2. **What features would make this a daily tool?** (PDF export? URL sharing? Team collaboration?)
3. **Are the results useful?** Do the forecasts feel actionable?

I'll be here all day answering questions about the methodology, implementation, or how to apply this to your projects.

Thanks for checking it out! 🚀

## Response Templates

### If someone asks "Why not just use [paid tool]?"
"Great question! Tools like [X] are powerful for enterprises, but I wanted something **instant and free** for smaller teams or individual PMs. No signup friction, no learning curve, just quick forecasts. Think of it as the 'calculator app' of project estimation."

### If someone asks "How accurate is this?"
"The accuracy depends on your inputs. If you use real historical throughput data from a stable team, it's quite accurate. The Central Limit Theorem (the math behind this) is proven statistics. That said, it can't predict unforeseen external factors—it models uncertainty in *known* variables."

### If someone asks "Can I use this for [specific use case]?"
"Probably! It works for any project where you can estimate story count and team throughput. I've used it for software sprints, marketing campaigns, and even home renovation projects. If you can break work into countable units, it'll work."

### If someone suggests a feature
"Love that idea! I'm keeping a backlog of requested features. Would you be interested in beta testing that when it's ready?"
