# Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Idea

Make the Monte Carlo estimation tool installable as a Progressive Web App - users can add it to their home screen and use it offline.

## Notes

- Would need service worker for offline functionality
- Manifest file for installability
- Could cache the single HTML file easily
- Mobile users would get app-like experience
- Consider what data needs to work offline (probably just the calculator logic, not AdSense)
